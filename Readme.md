## How install

Using npm: npm install private-telegram-bot

## First use

Before use it you must create a bot in Telegram bot platform. It’s very easy:

	- From your Telegram in your mobile, talk with @botFather
	- Say him: /newbot and follow his instructions
	- After bot creation, @botFather’ll give you a token. Save it! Its very important!

More info here: https://core.telegram.org/bots
With token of your new bot, edit /config/bot.json and add your token value to ‘token’ property

Update node path inside the scripts, otherwise you'll get a ENOENT (Entity not fount error).
---> /Users/<user>/.nvm/versions/node/v8.5.0/bin/node
or update /usr/bin/node to the correct executable

Everything is ready… run with: ./private-telegram-bot.js
Now you can launch commands from your Telegram bot, from your mobile. Send /help to see which commands you have ready to run.

## How add your own commands

Easy. You can add any script in public or admin scripts folder. The name of your script will be a command.

By default, public and admin script folders are:
	[project folder]/publicScripts
  [project folder]/adminScripts

Only you (the bot owner) can run the ‘admins scripts’. Only who you want can run ‘public scripts’ (check ‘adduser’ and ‘removeuser’ commands)
You can change public and admin folder path properties in bot configuration file (bot.json)
You can add and remove commands, users, change configuration properties… without restart any process. Private-telegram-bot will detect and rebuild it any required object to get change.

## How to configure it

Only bot token is required to use it but, if you want to know how to modify bot behaviour, you can do it editing simple json property files in config folder.
Change bot language (currently ‘en’ and ‘es’ values), create rotate file log files, set commands timeout… etc Open your config files and take a look!
